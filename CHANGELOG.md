# Changelog

## v1.13.14 - 2026-03-09

- Fixed backup/restore to include reconciliation-related settings (anchored starting balances, verified balances per account, and profile PIN length metadata).
- Fixed verified bank balance persistence so each account keeps its own independent value (no cross-account carryover).
- Improved login PIN UX/security with a single line-style input (instead of segmented boxes) and profile-specific auto-submit behavior based on stored PIN length.
- Added backend persistence for PIN length per profile and wired profile list responses to include `pinLength`.
- Refined expenses pagination behavior so `Todo el tiempo` suggests/selects total rows and non-`Todo el tiempo` modes reset to 20 rows per page.

## v1.13.13 - 2026-03-09

- Improved expenses reconciliation UX with clearer sections for reconciliation status and period breakdown.
- Added anchor-based balance workflow (`Fijar saldo desde aqui`) to set balances from a selected movement and auto-recalculate forward months.
- Updated key labels/tooltips in Spanish/English for clarity (`Descuadre`, `Neto`, actions tooltips, filters text, etc.).
- Moved the table columns button next to rows-per-page and improved pagination options with dynamic total rows option.
- Fixed date filter input behavior and calendar usability while keeping ISO-style (`yyyy-mm-dd`) workflow.
- Improved action buttons layout in the table to avoid icon overlap.
- Added defensive handling for invalid pagination/column config states to prevent empty table rendering.
- Improved i18n behavior to use browser locale when no saved language is present.
